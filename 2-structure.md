**STRUCTURE**
At first, insights will be given into the myriad of techniques that were used in producing the short film 
“Borrowed Limbs”. The production pipeline developed while making the film and the technologies involved 
will be briefly explained. In the following, workshop participants are introduced to a modified version of the 
aforementioned Google Colab Notebook VQGAN+CLIP. At this stage there will be a small excurse delving 
into what makes the Machine Learning models involved in the image-diffusion-process behave the way they 
do: we will look at the training data being used to train CLIP and certain GANs. explain - on a very high 
level - how image diffusion works. The central task will be to select an organism, human or non-human, and 
describe a future collaboration with the AI as a new species. These speculative concepts will be visualized 
with the techniques learned before. The results will be discussed as they will reflect on certain aspects of 
future developments, projected by the participants (synthesized meaning). Some results will also reveal 
learnings about how the model ‘ticks’ some hypotheses on the training data and how natural language is 
processed can be drawn and discussed. Outcomes will be made accessible in the browser with either a self-
hosted Jupyter book (jupyterbook.org) or with a productivity software such as Notion, resulting in a gallery 
representing future visions of Machine collaboratio
